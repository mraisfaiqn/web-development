    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Software engineer with a background in embedded systems, currently building my full-stack web
      development skills with modern client- and server-side frameworks, while also exploring the exciting realms of artificial intelligence and functional programming. Over the past 5+ years, I’ve had the privilege of developing and deploying IoT-based products, creating user-friendly GUIs, and connecting applications to both local and cloud databases. As my company pivoted into the corporate gifts and premiums sector, I embraced the opportunity to expand my role by handling major client operations and managing e-commerce for their new brand. With experience bridging both hardware and software, I’m passionate about crafting meaningful digital solutions and eager to contribute to a focused,
      collaborative software engineering team.
