        <p>
          Hey there! I’m Faiq, a software engineer who loves creating things that make life a little easier (and a little more fun). I started out building embedded systems like smart lockers and touchscreen applications, but these days you’ll find me diving into web development, cloud tech and exploring the exciting worlds of AI and functional programming. I’m a big believer in learning by doing, solving problems one step at a time, keeping things simple and with purpose. When I’m not busy coding or tinkering with new ideas, I’m usually recharging through the things I love:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>An avid racquet sports guy (pretty much any racquet sport you can imagine!)</li>
          <li>Socialising and mastering emotional control (especially through a good round of golf with the lads)</li>
          <li>Chasing scenic beaches and ocean vibes (scuba diving and mental health resets)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Thanks for stopping by, I hope you enjoy exploring a little piece of my journey!
